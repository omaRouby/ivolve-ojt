This project involves setting up a Jenkins pipeline to build, push, and deploy a Java application onto an OpenShift cluster using an EC2 agent. The pipeline utilizes a shared library for common functions and configurations.

- **Repository**: [Jenkins Build and Deploy Java App](https://github.com/omaRouby/jenkins-ivolve.git)
- **Shared Library Repository**: [Jenkins Shared Library for OpenShift](https://github.com/omaRouby/shared-lib-oc.git)

## Project 2: Jenkins Deployment Pipeline for Python App

This project focuses on deploying a Python application onto an OpenShift cluster using Jenkins pipelines and a shared library for streamlined deployment workflows.

- **Repository**: [Jenkins Deployment Pipeline for Python App](https://github.com/omaRouby/Jenkins2-ivolve.git)
- **Shared Library Repository**: [Jenkins Shared Library for Python](https://github.com/omaRouby/share-library-python.git)

These projects leverage Jenkins pipelines and shared libraries to automate the build and deployment processes, improving efficiency and consistency in application delivery.
